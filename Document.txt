cursor is used to perform all the task so that all the operation done in database 
it is used here coz we cannot assign operation to database directly
cursor is act as manager of the database 

Just like in store , if we have to  access store then we call sotremanager who mangaes the data in the  database



Table->

a database can contain multiple tables 


DataBase->
            sqlite table ko seen krne ke liye sqlite viewer ka use krte hai 
        create table function mai ->
            first : connect with sqlite using a variable 
            2nd : variable ke sath connect ka use krege named cursor who do maintain database and manage all the  operations 
            3rd: assign execute operation to cursor and create table if not exist 
            4th : deifne table by using query and define all the columns of the table 
            5th : database ko commit krege
            6th : database ko close krege 

    Note-> when do database open , need to close at last for not further changes


Run of table ->
    createtable function ko main file mai import krenge 

    
if __name__ == '__main__':         
    
    createTable()
    app.run(debug=True)  

yha par cratetable function ko run krege 


in createTable uuid is an unique key generated automatically and will be same for both user and admin 

use try catch for error handling 

user se related saare api ko ek module User mai create krege
